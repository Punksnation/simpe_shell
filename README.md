The Simple Shell Team Project is a C language program that functions as a UNIX command language interpreter. It reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them. The program works by first printing a prompt and waiting for a command from the user. Then, it creates a child process in which the command is checked. It checks for built-ins, aliases in the PATH, and local executable programs. The child process is replaced by the command, which accepts arguments. When the command is done, the program returns to the parent process and prints the prompt, making it ready to receive a new command. To exit the program, the user can press Ctrl-D or enter "exit" (with or without a status). The program also works in non-interactive mode.
To compile the program, the user can use the following command:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o sshell
It is important to note that all files must be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc and the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89. Additionally, all files must end with a new line, and a README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory. The Betty style must be used to check using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl. The program should not have any memory leaks, and no more than 5 functions should be in each file. All header files should be include guarded.
